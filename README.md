## Features
List of TODOs for future development:

* __Food Allergy Warning__: Warn the user if one of the recipes could trigger a food allergy. 
* __Database Creation__: Import a MySQL dump to reference when searching for recipes.
* __Recipe Recommendation__: Create an algorithm that takes a list of cocktail ingredients, searches a database for recipes with those ingredients, and returns a list of the top ten recipes that include those ingredients.
* __User Interface__: Create an UI on the web that provides an interface in which to interact with the program.

To-do list:
* Wow improvement to be done 1
