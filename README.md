# WitchesBrew
>  FeedMe started out with a team of five versatile developers by the names of:
> 
> * Benjamin Bond
> * Jonathan Crouch
> * Evan Estrada
> * Andrew Saenz
>
> with a vision to create an application that helps prevent good ingredients from going to waste. We want to help individuals with limited mixing experience create recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home.

## General info
![Cocktail](/Cocktail.png). 

This is a best effort at creating a recipe recommendation program. For the moment, we are specializing in cocktail recipes. We hope to find a database full of a wide variety of recipes or make our own.

## Features
List of TODOs for future development:

* __Food Allergy Warning__: Warn the user if one of the recipes could trigger a food allergy. Casual users use this. Ben's first user story corresponds to this feature.
* __Database Creation__: Import a MySQL dump to reference when searching for recipes. All users indirectly use this. Ben's first user story corresponds to this feature. 
* __Recipe Recommendation__: Create an algorithm that takes a list of cocktail ingredients, searches a database for recipes with those ingredients, and returns a list of the top ten recipes that include those ingredients. Casual users use this. Ben's first user story corresponds to this feature. 
* __User Interface__: Create an UI on the web that provides an interface in which users interact with the program. Andrew's second user story corresponds to this feature.
#__Gamification__: Users can pass ingredients to the random command to pick random recipes instead of highly rated/first five recipes in database table. Evan's first story corresponds to this.

## Status

We have successfully built our database, built the front-end of the website, and have connected the two. We have also implemented a search of database recipes as well as a typehead for both searches.

## Inspiration
Project inspired by our team's weak mixing skills, based on the idea of backward searching.
